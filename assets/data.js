Last year, V had shared what happened to his older unreleased solo material, saying that he has since shelved all those songs and Im writing new ones.

You are doing a Tony Soprano thing, the voice was a really exciting and daunting challenge.</q> <br><br><br> <q>We know a little bit about Charles Martinet voice that he is  sprinkled in there with the &apos;Wahoo!&apos; and &apos;It is me!&apos; and these Mario things, but how do you craft a 90-minute narrative with an emotional through line and create a living, breathing person about who you will care?</q> <br><br><br><br> <q>I tried out a few things and landed on something that I am really proud of and cannot wait for people to see and hear. It is an animated voiceover narrative. It is not a live-action movie. I am not going be wearing a plumber suit running all over. I am providing a voice for an animated character, and it is updated and unlike anything you have heard in the Mario world before.</q> <br><br><br><br><br> Jelenic and Horvath later defended casting Pratt, telling Total Film magazine that finding the perfect Mario voice meant finding an actor who could believably portray a plumber from Brooklyn who is <q>a blue-collar guy from a family of Italian immigrants.</q> <br><br><br> <q>For us, it made total sense. Chris is really good at playing a blue-collar hero with a ton of heart. For the way that Mario is characterized in our film, he is perfect for it.</q>"

      "berita": "The Sacramento Kings are having themselves a dream season, which comes as a result of some very good front-office decisions. It started with trading Tyrese Haliburton for Domantas Sabonis, who could very well end up as a top-five MVP finisher. <br><br> Giving up Haliburton was not a move many teams would have made, but with DeAaron Fox in place, the Kings knew what they needed more than another point guard was a bruising big man who could facilitate offense. <br><br> The Kings also knew they needed shooting to properly space an offensive attack built around the blazing penetration of Fox and the low-post scoring high-post passing of Sabonis. So last summer they went out and got two marksmen in Kevin Huerter and Keegan Murray. <br><br> Huerter, who has been spectacular this season, came in a trade from Atlanta. Murray came by way of the No. 4 pick in the draft. The Kings could have gone a lot of ways with that selection, and what a pivotal decision it has turned out to be that in the end they went with Murray, who on Wednesday night broke the NBA record for most 3-pointers in a season by a rookie with his 188th triple of his debut campaign. <br><br>  Murray surpassed Donovan Mitchell previous rookie record of 187 3-pointers. Damian Lillard is third all time with 185. Those guys are superstars. Murray is not, and he was never really projected to be. Yes, it is hard to call a No. 4 overall pick a sleeper, but Murray, at least at the time, was seen more as a choice of practicality than potential. <br><br> Once you got outside the top three, Ivey or Sharpe were seen as the guys with the most star upside. But Murray was a player. A lights-out shooter and long-armed defender. For the same reason that Haliburton was traded, Murray made the most sense for the Kings. Ivey, who also made it clear he didn't want to go to Sacramento, was another Fox."

      "berita": "It seems to me, and maybe this is because Im more in tune with all things Warriors than any other team in the NBA, that frustrations regarding the way Golden State, and more specifically Stephen Curry, are being officiated are higher than normal this season. Two things about that. One, the Warriors are two games above 500 clinging to a playoff spot with one of the worst road records in the league. Fans are on edge, and thus, even more prone to whining than usual. <br><br> Two, the Warriors extreme free-throw disparity has been widely cited all season. At 20.1 per game, Golden State attempts the fewest free throws in the league. At 25.4 per game, their opponents attempt the sixth-most free throws in the league. <br><br> This is a hill they are trying to climb every night, and it is steep. You have to make a lot of shots to overcome that kind of free-throw discrepancy, and the natural tendency is to want to blame the refs, as though this is a league-wide initiative to keep the Warriors off the free-throw line. <br><br> This is madness. And it needs to stop. Though I am fully aware that it will not. Scapegoating officials for your own inadequacies is a time-honored basketball tradition. <br><br> But back here, in reality, teams and players have, barring exceptions, been making their own luck with officials since basketball started. Which is to say, to whatever extent the Warriors get an unlucky whistle, it is their own fault. <br><br> You want to shoot more free throws? Attack the rim more. Golden State initiates 36.8 drives per game, per NBA.com tracking data, the second-fewest in the league. What is more, on those 36.8 drives per game, they pass out of them 42.3 percent of the time, which is the league second-highest drive-to-pass ratio."

Meanwhile, three police officers charged with ordering the firing of tear gas that led to the stampede await verdicts. <br><br> The chaos at the Oct. 1 match began after police fired tear gas to disperse angry spectators who invaded the pitch at the stadium after hosts Arema FC lost to fierce East Java rival Persebaya Surabaya. <br><br> Smoke from the tear gas sent spectators scrambling for the exit gates, causing the stampede, officials had said. Police said the stadium had a capacity of 40,000, but more than 60,000 tickets were sold. <br><br> A fact finding team set up by Indonesian President Joko Widodo found that tear gas fired indiscriminately by police caused the stampede. Authorities said other factors including narrow stadium gates at the exits contributed to the disaster. The tragedy sparked public outrage and calls for accountability from football authorities and law enforcement agencies."

According to the NGO Global Forest Watch, the new forest loss in Indonesia was within areas that Indonesia classifies as secondary forests and thus outside forests that Indonesia classifies as primary. Forest-clearing mega-fires continue to destroy irreplaceable biodiversity and contribute to climate change, which carries a heavy burden on the population of the region and the world.<br><br> The Indonesian government continues to be a vocal opponent of new deforestation efforts. Just look at their opposition to the new EU Deforestation regulations. The country argued that it would put an undue burden on smallholder farmers, but backed off that position in the face of the support of the Indonesian palm oil smallholders union. <br><br> The country is also openly angered by the new rules and even sent envoys to the EU to defend its policies. Since then the country has continued to resist the new measures by imposing export bans and pledging to fight. <br><br> But opposition may not even be necessary because it is also well known that the palm oil industry has various ways to get around no-deforestation pledges. First, mass balance sourcing allows certified and non-certified ingredients to be mixed during shipping and manufacturing."

If they don&apos;t, they may end up losing Doncic. <br><br> The Mavericks pulling the plug on the season by sitting virtually its entire core against Chicago on Friday night, while still mathematically alive for the play-in tournament, might not have sat well with Doncic, who had been very clear about his desire to keep fighting as long as Dallas had a shot at the postseason.<br><br> These are the kinds of things you hear about two years later, when Doncic is in a different uniform. If the Mavericks don&apos;t want that to happen, there may not be much more room for error. The team has said its first order of business will be re-signing Irving to a long-term extension. Who knows what they&apos;ll do with Christian Wood, also a free agent. <br><br> The Irving commitment would be a risky move to say the least. Under normal circumstances, a lot of teams wouldn&apos;t want anything to do with Irving long-term. But the Mavericks don&apos;t have the means, or likely even the opportunity in terms of available free agents, to replace Irving&apos;s talent in the short term. <br><br> They already let Jalen Brunson get away. They were a better team before they made the trade for Irving, but now that it&apos;s done, if he walks now, Doncic might follow. <br><br> This is why Dallas punted on the season on Friday. The 2023 first-round pick that the Mavericks owe to the Knicks as the final piece of the Kristaps Porzingis trade is top-10 protected. Losing that game gives Dallas the 10th best lottery odds, on the dot, upping their chances of landing in the top 10 and keeping the pick. which the Mavericks could potentially use as part of a trade package this summer to further outfit Doncic and Irving with a legitimate championship-contending cast. They better start by adding some defenders"

      "berita" : "The Dallas Mavericks, eliminated from playoff contention two months after trading for Kyrie Irving in what was a desperate attempt to put a co-star alongside Luka Doncic, are in an extremely precarious situation, and they have to get it right heading into a summer of franchise-altering decisions. If they don&apos;t, they may end up losing Doncic. <br><br> The Mavericks pulling the plug on the season by sitting virtually its entire core against Chicago on Friday night, while still mathematically alive for the play-in tournament, might not have sat well with Doncic, who had been very clear about his desire to keep fighting as long as Dallas had a shot at the postseason.<br><br> These are the kinds of things you hear about two years later, when Doncic is in a different uniform. If the Mavericks don&apos;t want that to happen, there may not be much more room for error. The team has said its first order of business will be re-signing Irving to a long-term extension. Who knows what they&apos;ll do with Christian Wood, also a free agent. <br><br> The Irving commitment would be a risky move to say the least. Under normal circumstances, a lot of teams wouldn&apos;t want anything to do with Irving long-term. But the Mavericks don&apos;t have the means, or likely even the opportunity in terms of available free agents, to replace Irving&apos;s talent in the short term. <br><br> They already let Jalen Brunson get away. They were a better team before they made the trade for Irving, but now that it&apos;s done, if he walks now, Doncic might follow. <br><br> This is why Dallas punted on the season on Friday. The 2023 first-round pick that the Mavericks owe to the Knicks as the final piece of the Kristaps Porzingis trade is top-10 protected. Losing that game gives Dallas the 10th best lottery odds, on the dot, upping their chances of landing in the top 10 and keeping the pick. which the Mavericks could potentially use as part of a trade package this summer to further outfit Doncic and Irving with a legitimate championship-contending cast. They better start by adding some defenders"
